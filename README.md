## *Neural-Network-Classification-on-Credit-Usage*
## Data found inside CSV file [ToyotaCorolla.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18607138/ToyotaCorolla.csv)

### This Python script implements a neural network classification model to predict whether an individual has used credit based on their years of experience and salary. The dataset includes features such as Years and Salary, and the target variable is 'Used Credit'. The data is first scaled to the range [0, 1] using MinMaxScaler. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is trained using 60% of the data, and predictions are made on the remaining 40%. The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report, with a heatmap generated for better visualization of the confusion matrix. The final accuracy score on the validation set is also displayed.
